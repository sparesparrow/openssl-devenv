## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### SBOM Generation Process
```yaml
- name: Generate SBOM for build artifacts
  if: success() || failure()
  run: |
    # Create build directory for SBOM generation
    mkdir -p build-artifacts
    cp -r . build-artifacts/
    
    # Generate SBOM using Syft
    docker run --rm -v $(pwd)/build-artifacts:/workspace anchore/syft:latest \
      /workspace -o cyclonedx-json > openssl-basic-gcc-sbom.json
```

### Security Scanning Integration
```yaml
- name: Run security scan using Track A workflow
  uses: sparesparrow/openssl-conan-base/.github/workflows/reusable-sbom-generation.yml@main
  with:
    artifact-name: 'openssl-tools-artifacts'
    output-format: 'cyclonedx-json'
    severity-threshold: 'HIGH'
    upload-to-dependency-track: false
```

### Workflow Triggers
- **Push Events**: Automatic triggering on pushes to main branches
- **Pull Requests**: Security scanning on all pull requests
- **Scheduled Runs**: Weekly CodeQL analysis, daily SBOM generation
- **Manual Triggers**: Workflow dispatch for on-demand security scanning

## 📊 Monitoring and Results

### GitHub Security Tab Integration
- **Code Scanning Alerts**: CodeQL findings are displayed in the Security tab
- **Dependabot Alerts**: Dependency vulnerabilities are tracked
- **SARIF Results**: Trivy scan results are uploaded as SARIF files
- **Security Advisories**: Repository security advisories are monitored

### Workflow Artifacts
- **SBOM Files**: Available for download from workflow runs (90-day retention)
- **Security Reports**: FIPS compliance reports and vulnerability summaries
- **Build Artifacts**: Consolidated build artifacts for comprehensive scanning

### Monitoring Scripts
```bash
# Check workflow status and security findings
./scripts/monitor-security-results.sh

# Enable Track A workflows
./scripts/enable-track-a-workflows.sh
```

## 🚀 Usage Instructions

### 1. Monitor Security Results
```bash
# Run from openssl-devenv root directory
./scripts/monitor-security-results.sh
```

This script will:
- Check workflow run status across all repositories
- Display security alerts and findings
- Provide summary of Track A results
- Show CodeQL and Dependabot alerts

### 2. Manual Workflow Triggers
```bash
# Trigger SBOM generation
gh workflow run reusable-sbom-generation.yml --repo sparesparrow/openssl-conan-base

# Trigger FIPS validation
gh workflow run fips-validation.yml --repo sparesparrow/openssl-fips-policy

# Trigger CodeQL analysis
gh workflow run codeql-analysis.yml --repo sparesparrow/openssl
```

### 3. Review Security Findings
1. **GitHub Security Tab**: Navigate to Security > Code scanning alerts
2. **Workflow Artifacts**: Download SBOM files from workflow runs
3. **SARIF Results**: Review Trivy scan results in the Security tab
4. **FIPS Reports**: Check FIPS compliance reports in workflow artifacts
